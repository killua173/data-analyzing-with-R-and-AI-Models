Hypothesis Formulation
Hypothesis:
The total number of flights (TOTAL_FLIGHTS) at various airports is influenced by the year (YEAR), the month (MONTH_NUM), and the specific airport identifier (APT_ICAO).

Objective:
To build a linear regression model to identify significant predictors of the total number of flights, quantify their effects, and assess the model's performance.

Description and Interpretation of the Model Results
Variables Chosen:

YEAR: Captures trends or changes in flight patterns over time.
MONTH_NUM: Captures seasonal variations in air travel.
APT_ICAO: Accounts for differences in airport capacities and demands.

Model Summary:

Adjusted R-squared: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
F-statistic: Tests the overall significance of the model.
P-values: Indicate the statistical significance of each coefficient.
Evaluation Metrics:

Adjusted R-squared: Reflects how well the model explains the variability.
F-statistic: Assesses the overall significance of the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between observed and predicted values.
Model Interpretation
YEAR:
Significant coefficients indicate notable year-to-year changes in flight numbers.
MONTH_NUM:
Significant coefficients reveal seasonal patterns in flight numbers.
APT_ICAO:
Significant coefficients identify airports with consistently higher or lower flight volumes.

Model Quality and Assumptions
Model Quality:

Adjusted R-squared: Higher values suggest a better fit.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Lower values indicate better prediction accuracy.
Model Assumptions:

Linearity:
Checked using a plot of fitted values vs. residuals.
Normality of Residuals:
Checked using a QQ plot.

Conclusion
The linear regression model indicates that the total number of flights is significantly influenced by the year, month, and specific airport. The adjusted R-squared value suggests how well these factors explain the variability in flight numbers, and the significant predictors highlight important trends and patterns. The model's assumptions are checked using diagnostic plots, and the overall fit is evaluated using metrics like adjusted R-squared and MSE. This analysis helps us understand the key drivers of flight volumes and provides a foundation for further refinement and comparison with other models.

Hypothesis Formulation
Hypothesis:
The total number of flights (TOTAL_FLIGHTS) is influenced by the state (STATE_NAME), year (YEAR), month (MONTH_NUM), and day of the week (DAY_OF_WEEK).

Objective:
To build a linear regression model to identify significant predictors of the total number of flights, quantify their effects, and assess the model's performance.

Description and Interpretation of the Model Results
Variables Chosen:

STATE_NAME: Differences in flight volumes across states.
YEAR: Trends or changes in flight patterns over time.
MONTH_NUM: Seasonal variations in air travel.
DAY_OF_WEEK: Weekly patterns in flight numbers.

Model Summary:

Adjusted R-squared: 0.1717
F-statistic: 1784, p-value < 2.2e-16
Residual Standard Error: 386.7
Coefficients Interpretation:

Many states, years, months, and days of the week have significant coefficients indicating their influence on the number of flights.
The most significant positive coefficients include STATE_NAME[Denmark], STATE_NAME[Switzerland], and STATE_NAME[Finland].
Negative coefficients include STATE_NAME[Lithuania] and STATE_NAME[North Macedonia], indicating fewer flights relative to the baseline.
Model Evaluation
Evaluation Metrics:

Adjusted R-squared: 0.1717 indicates that 17.17% of the variability in TOTAL_FLIGHTS is explained by the model.
F-statistic: 1784 indicates the overall significance of the model.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): 147860.5 measures the average squared difference between observed and predicted values.
Model Quality and Assumptions
Model Quality:

Adjusted R-squared: Indicates a modest fit, explaining 17.17% of the variance.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Lower values indicate better prediction accuracy

Conclusion
The linear regression model indicates that the total number of flights is significantly influenced by the state, year, month, and day of the week. The adjusted R-squared value suggests a modest fit, explaining 17.17% of the variability in flight numbers. The model reveals significant trends and patterns, with notable positive and negative effects from different states, years, months, and days of the week. However, the model assumptions indicate issues with homoscedasticity and multicollinearity, suggesting areas for further refinement and improvement.

Formulating a Hypothesis
We begin by hypothesizing that airports can be categorized into distinct clusters based on their operational characteristics, such as total flights, departures, arrivals, and the ratio of departures to arrivals. We anticipate that these clusters represent different types of airports with similar operational patterns. By segmenting airports into clusters, we aim to identify common operational profiles and understand the underlying factors driving these patterns. This hypothesis serves as the foundation for our K-means clustering analysis.

Description and Interpretation of Model Results
Our K-means clustering analysis provides insights into the operational characteristics of airports and identifies distinct clusters within the data.

Variables Selection:
We chose total flights, departures, arrivals, and the departure to arrival ratio as our variables of interest. These variables are fundamental indicators of airport activity and provide valuable insights into operational dynamics.
Interpretation of Results:
Each cluster represents a unique group of airports with similar operational profiles.
Cluster 1: This cluster comprises airports with significantly higher than average total flights, departures, and arrivals, indicating busy airports with high traffic volume. The departure to arrival ratio is slightly higher than average.
Cluster 2: Airports in this cluster exhibit below-average total flights, departures, and arrivals, with a notably lower departure to arrival ratio.
Cluster 3: This is the largest cluster, containing airports with around average total flights, departures, and arrivals. The departure to arrival ratio is close to average.
Cluster 4: Airports in this cluster demonstrate significantly higher than average total flights, departures, and arrivals, with a departure to arrival ratio slightly above average.
Evaluation of Model Quality:
We evaluated the model's quality using the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) and silhouette width.
Lower WCSS values indicate tighter clusters, while higher silhouette widths suggest better cluster separation.
Comparison of Models:
We compared models with different numbers of clusters to identify the optimal number. This involved assessing the trade-off between model complexity and cluster separation.
The selected number of clusters balances cluster cohesion and separation, providing meaningful insights into airport classifications.

Interpretation of Results:

Cluster 1: This cluster comprises airports with significantly higher than average total flights, departures, and arrivals, indicating busy airports with high traffic volume. The departure to arrival ratio is slightly higher than average. These airports may serve as major hubs or key destinations.
Cluster 2: Airports in this cluster exhibit below-average total flights, departures, and arrivals, with a notably lower departure to arrival ratio. These airports might represent smaller regional airports or those with specialized operations.
Cluster 3: This is the largest cluster, containing airports with around average total flights, departures, and arrivals. The departure to arrival ratio is close to average. These airports likely represent a broad spectrum of mid-sized facilities with balanced traffic patterns.
Cluster 4: Airports in this cluster demonstrate significantly higher than average total flights, departures, and arrivals, with a departure to arrival ratio slightly above average. These airports may serve as major departure points or have high outbound traffic due to tourism or business activities.

A- Description of Actions Taken
In the provided R Notebook, several actions were taken to analyze and manipulate the dataset flights.csv. Here's a summary of the steps:

Data Import and Inspection:

The dataset flights.csv was imported using readr::read_csv.
Initial exploration of the dataset using functions like head, summary, and str to understand its structure, contents, and any missing values.
Data Cleaning and Imputation:

Checked for missing values (NA) across columns using any(is.na(flights)).
Imputed missing values with zeros using flights[is.na(flights)] <- 0.
Data Transformation:

Created new variables and transformations:
Calculated cumulative counts (YTD_IFR_FLIGHTS, YTD_VFR_FLIGHTS).
Combined variables to derive new insights (TOTAL_FLIGHTS, AVG_DEP_PER_FLIGHT, AVG_ARR_PER_FLIGHT).
Normalized variables (NORM_IFR_FLIGHTS, NORM_VFR_FLIGHTS).
Extracted temporal components (QUARTER, DAY_OF_WEEK).
Performed cumulative sums and additional calculations to enrich the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Created various visualizations to explore relationships and patterns in the data:
Line plots (Total Flights Over Time, Cumulative Total Flights Year-to-Date).
Heatmaps (Flight Activity by Month and Day).
Bar charts (Flight Activity by State).
Box plots (Monthly Flight Distribution).
Cluster analysis (K-means clustering).
Each visualization aimed to uncover insights into flight patterns, activity levels, and trends over time.
Model Building and Evaluation:

Constructed linear regression models to predict TOTAL_FLIGHTS based on predictors such as YEAR, MONTH_NUM, APT_ICAO, STATE_NAME, and DAY_OF_WEEK.
Evaluated model performance using metrics like adjusted R-squared, F-statistic, p-values, and mean squared error (MSE).
Assessed model assumptions including linearity, normality of residuals, homoscedasticity, and multicollinearity.
Hypothesis Formulation and Testing:

Formulated hypotheses regarding factors influencing TOTAL_FLIGHTS.
Tested hypotheses using statistical models and interpreted results to draw conclusions about significant predictors.
b-Conclusion

Successfully imported, cleaned, and transformed the dataset for analysis.
Conducted comprehensive EDA to visualize flight patterns and relationships.
Built and evaluated predictive models to understand factors affecting TOTAL_FLIGHTS.
Tested hypotheses and interpreted results to identify significant predictors of flight activity.

c-What Was Accomplished:

Identified temporal trends in flight activity (Total Flights Over Time, Monthly Flight Distribution).
Explored regional variations in flight volumes (Flight Activity by State).
Analyzed operational characteristics using clustering (K-means clustering).
Established predictive models to understand the impact of temporal and spatial factors on flight volumes.



c- I am not sure, though, I don't like the models I made much.

d- Better models; maybe group some data together to reduce the variables, especially the airports and region.

e- Thinking of a model that would make sense with the huge amount of airports.

f- Trying to understand the data and make sense of it; I find the whole course interesting.

g- Scaling and factoring the data so it doesn't break the model.

h- I would try to understand the data better, group some variables, and make better models with a better understanding of the dataframe.

i- Start the project all over again and spend some time analyzing the data itself more.

j- Better models and would,and would finish in less time.
